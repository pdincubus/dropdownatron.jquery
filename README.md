# dropdownatron.jquery

A jQuery plugin to provide stylised select boxes.

## Usage

```javascript
$('select').dropdownatron();
```

Only three options are provided:

* `speed` the speed of the animation
* `easing` the easing used in the animation, set to something sexy if you have [http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/](extra easing functions) installed
* `animation` either `animate` or `fade`, defines what animation to use

## Thanks

[http://github.com/pdincubus](Phil Steer) for his update to allow differing animation methods.
